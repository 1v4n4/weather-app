# Weather
This weather forecast site uses weather OpenWeatherMap.org API to get weather data for cities worldwide. By entering the name of the location, users get the current weather data.

Temperature is displayed in Celsius by default, but it can be changed to Fahrenheit (and back) by clicking on F/C letters next to the current temperature.

The design is basic and responsive. There are different backgrounds for some weather conditions.

## Getting API key

  An API key is necessary for using OpenWeatherMap data that can be obtained at the Open Weather's website, after registration. That key must be added at the end of an URL request for fetching API's data. Basic data packages are free. More information can be found here `https://openweathermap.org/current`.
  However, this app has API key build in, and it can be used without any credentials.
